Image Blending with Homography
Algorithm Overview
The algorithm implemented in this code performs image blending using homography, combining two grayscale images seamlessly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Load Images:

Load two grayscale images (home0.jpeg and Home.jpeg) to be blended.
Feature Detection and Matching:

Use the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm to detect keypoints and compute descriptors for both images.
Initialize a brute-force matcher (cv2.BFMatcher()) to match descriptors between the images.
Select Top Matches:

Select the top N matches with the lowest distance between keypoints, where N is defined by num_matches.
Homography Estimation:

Extract the matching keypoints and use them to estimate a homography matrix (cv2.findHomography()).
The RANSAC algorithm is employed to robustly estimate the homography, minimizing the influence of outliers.
Warping and Blending:

Warp the first image using the estimated homography matrix (cv2.warpPerspective()).
Blend the warped image with the second image using alpha blending (cv2.addWeighted()).
The blending factor (alpha) controls the contribution of each image to the final result.
Display Result:

Display the blended image using cv2.imshow().
Customization
You can experiment with the number of matches (num_matches) to control the influence of keypoints on the homography estimation.
Adjust the alpha blending factor (alpha) to customize the visual appearance of the blended image.
Feel free to explore and modify the code for your specific image blending requirements.
